# RQL

`RQL` (Ruhis Query Language) is a powerful library designed to simplify the process of filtering, sorting, and aggregating large amounts of data. With RQL, you can effortlessly extract valuable insights from complex datasets, making data analysis and manipulation tasks more efficient. RQL was initially developed for an internal SIEM project, so it is well suited for security-related use cases, but it can be used for any type of data.
